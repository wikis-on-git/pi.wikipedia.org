In [[Buddhism]], a '''Buddha''' ([[Sanskrit]], [[Pāli]]) is any being who has become fully awakened or [[Bodhi|enlightened]], has permanently overcome [[anger]], [[greed]], and [[ignorance]], and has achieved complete liberation from [[suffering]], better known as [[Nirvana]].  It is commonly used to refer to [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha Gautama]], the historical founder of [[Buddhism]]. ''Buddha'' literally means "awakened" or "that which has become aware".  It is the [[past participle]] of the [[Sanskrit]] root ''budh'', i.e. "to awaken", "to know", or "to become aware". The word ''Buddha'' is simply a title that means 'The Awakened One'.

A typical misconception tends to link Buddha as the Buddhist counterpart of the entity known as [[God]]; however, Buddhism is non-theistic, in the sense of not generally teaching the existence of a supreme Creator God (see [[God in Buddhism]]) or depending on any supreme being for enlightenment, in Buddhism, Buddha is a guide and teacher who points the way. The commonly accepted definition of the term "God" refers to a being who not only rules but actually created the Universe in the [[Origin belief|Beginning]]. Such ideas and concepts are disputed by Buddha and Buddhists in many of his discourses.  The supreme origin and creator of our world and universe isn't God in Buddhism, but [[Avidya]] or ignorance.  Buddhists try to dispel this darkness through constant practice, wisdom and compassion known as [[prajna]].

In the [[Pali Canon]] Buddha refers to anyone who has become Enlightened (i.e. having awakened to the truth, or ''[[Dharma]]'') on their own, without a teacher to point out the [[Dhamma|Dharma]], in a time when the teachings on the [[Four Noble Truths]] or the [[Eightfold Path]] do not exist in the world. 

Generally, Buddhists do not consider [[Siddhartha Gautama]] to have been the only Buddha. In the [[Pali Canon]] there is a mention of Gautama Buddha as being the 28th Buddha (see [[List of the 28 Buddhas]]). A common buddhist belief is that the next Buddha will be one named [[Maitreya]]. 

Buddhism teaches that anyone can become awakened and experience [[Nirvana]]. [[Theravada]] Buddhism teaches that one doesn't need to become a Buddha to become awakened and experience Nirvana, since an [[Arahant]] also has those qualities. Some Buddhist texts such as the [[Lotus Sutra]] imply that all beings will become Buddhas at some point in time.

== Types of Buddhas ==
{{main|Types of Buddhas}} 	 
			
In the [[Pali Canon]], there are considered to be two types of Buddhas: [[Samyaksambuddha]] (Sammasambuddha) and [[Pratyekabuddha|Pratyeka Buddha]] (Paccekabuddha).
			
1. [[Samyaksambuddha]]s (Pali: ''Sammasambuddha'') attains Buddhahood and decides to teach others the truth that he has discovered. They lead others to awakening by teaching the [[Dharma]] in a time or world where it has been forgotten or has not been taught before. The Historical Buddha, [[Siddhartha Gautama]], is considered a Samyak-sambuddha. See also the [[List of the 28 Buddhas|list of 28 sammasambuddhas]]

2. [[Pratyekabuddha]]s (Pali: ''Paccekabuddha''), sometimes called Silent Buddhas) are similar to Samyaksambuddhas in that they attain [[Nirvana]] and acquire the same powers as a Sammasambuddha does, but they choose not to teach what they have discovered. 
They are second to the Buddhas in their spiritual development. They do ordain others; their admonition is only in reference to good and proper conduct  (abhisamācārikasikkhā). In some texts, the Paccekabuddha is described as one who understands the Dharma by his own efforts, but does not obtain omniscience nor mastery over the Fruits (phalesu vasībhāvam).[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/pa/pacceka_buddha.htm]

One 12th century Theravadin commentary uses the term Savakabuddha to describe the enlightened disciple. According to this scripture there are 3 types of Buddhas. In this case, however, the common definition of the meaning of the word Buddha (as one who discovers the Dhamma without a teacher) does not apply any more. Mainstream Theravadin and Mahayana scriptures do not recognize this term and state there are only two kinds of Buddha.

Disciples of a Sammasambuddha are called [[Savaka]]s (hearers or followers) or [[Arahants]] (Noble One). These terms have slightly varied meanings but can all be used to describe the enlightened disciple. ''Anubuddha'' is a rarely used term, but was used by the Buddha in the ''Khuddakapatha''<ref> Ratanasutta:56</ref> as to those who become Buddha's after being given instruction.  Enlightened disciples attain Nirvana and Parinirvana as the two types of Buddhas do. The most generally used term for them is [[Arahant]].

==Characteristics of a Buddha==
===Nine characteristics===
Buddhists meditate on (or contemplate) the Buddha as having nine characteristics:

:"The Blessed One is:
:#a worthy one
:#perfectly self enlightened
:#stays in perfect knowledge
:#well gone
:#unsurpassed knower of the world
:#unsurpassed leader of persons to be tamed 
:#teacher of the Divine Gods and humans 
:#the Enlightened One
:#the Blessed One or fortunate one

These 9 characteristics are frequently mentioned in the [[Pali Canon]], and are chanted daily in many Buddhist monasteries.

===Spiritual realizations===

All traditions hold that a Buddha has completely purified his mind of greed, aversion and ignorance, and that he has put an end to [[samsara]]. A Buddha is fully awakened and has realized the ultimate truth of life ([[Dharma]]), and thus ended (for himself) the [[suffering]] which unawakened people experience in life. Also, a Buddha is complete in all spiritual powers that a human being can develop, and posesses them in the highest degree possible. 

===The Nature of Buddha===
{{see|Buddhology}}
The various buddhist schools hold some varying interpretations on the nature of Buddha. 

====Pali Canon: Buddha was human====
{{main|Buddha - God or Man}} 
From the [[Pali Canon]] emerges the view that Buddha was human, endowed with the greatest psychic powers ([[Kevatta Sutta]]). The body and mind (the five [[khandha]]s) of a Buddha are impermanent and changing, just like the body and mind of ordinary people. However, a Buddha recognizes the unchanging nature of the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]], which is an eternal principle and an unconditioned and timeless phenomenon. This view is common in the Theravada school, and the other [[early Buddhist schools]].

====Eternal Buddha in Mahayana Buddhism====
{{main|Eternal Buddha}}
Some schools of Mahayana Buddhism believe that the Buddha is no longer essentially a human being but has become a being of a different order altogether and that the Buddha, in his ultimate transcendental "body/mind" mode as [[Dharmakaya]], has an eternal and infinite life (see [[eternal Buddha]]) and is possessed of great and immeasurable qualities. In the [[Mahaparinirvana Sutra]] the Buddha declares: "Nirvana is stated to be eternally abiding. The Tathagata [Buddha] is also thus, eternally abiding, without change." This is a particularly important metaphysical and soteriological doctrine in the [[Lotus Sutra]] and the [[Tathagatagarbha]] sutras. According to the Tathagatagarbha sutras, failure to recognise the Buddha's eternity and - even worse - outright denial of that eternity is deemed a major obstacle to the attainment of complete Awakening ([[bodhi]]).

== Depictions of the Buddha in art ==

Buddhas are frequently represented in the form of statues and paintings. Commonly seen designs include: 
* Seated Buddha 
* Reclining Buddha 
* Standing Buddha 
*''[[Hotei]]'', the obese, [[Laughing Buddha]], usually seen in [[China]].  This figure is believed to be a representation of a medieval Chinese monk who is associated with Maitreya, the future Buddha, and it is therefore not technically a Buddha image.
* The 'Emaciated Buddha', which shows Siddartha Gautama during his extreme ascetic practice of starvation.

The Buddha statue shown calling for rain is a pose common in [[Laos]].

===Markings===

Most depictions of Buddha contain a certain number of ''markings'', which are considered the signs of his enlightenment. These signs vary regionally, but two are common:

* A protuberance on the top of the head (denoting superb mental accuity)
* Long earlobes (denoting superb perception)

In the [[Pali Canon]] there is frequent mention of a list of [[Thirty-two marks of the Buddha|32 physical marks of Buddha]].

===Hand-gestures===

The poses and hand-gestures of these statues, known respectively as [[asana]]s and [[mudra]]s, are significant to their overall meaning. The popularity of any particular mudra or asana tends to be region-specific, such as the ''[[Vajra]]'' (or ''Chi Ken-in'') mudra, which is popular in [[Japan]] and [[Korea]] but rarely seen in [[India]]. Others are more universally common, for example, the ''Varada'' (Wish Granting) mudra is common among standing statues of the Buddha, particularly when coupled with the ''Abhaya'' (Fearlessness and Protection) mudra.
