== History ==
{{main|History of computer science}}
The history of computer science predates the invention of the modern [[digital computer]]. Prior to the 1920s, the term  ''computer'' referred to a human clerk who performed calculations. Early researchers in what came to be called computer science, such as [[Kurt Gödel]], [[Alonzo Church]], and [[Alan Turing]], were interested in the question of computability: what things can be computed by a human clerk who simply follows a list of instructions with paper and pencil, for as long as necessary, and without ingenuity or insight? Part of the motivation for this work was the desire to develop ''computing machines'' that could automate the often tedious and error-prone work of a human computer. 

During the 1940s, as newer and more powerful computing machines were developed, the term ''computer'' came to refer to the machines rather than their human predecessors. As it became clear that computers could be used for more than just mathematical calculations, the field of computer science broadened to study [[computation]] in general. Computer science began to be established as a distinct academic discipline in the 1960s, with the creation of the first computer science departments and degree programs.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Denning|first=P.J.|year=2000|title=[http://www.idi.ntnu.no/emner/dif8916/denning.pdf Computer science:the discipline]|journal=Encyclopedia of Computer Science}}</ref>

==Major achievements==
{{section-stub}}

Despite its relatively short history as a formal academic discipline, computer science has made a number of fundamental contributions to science and society. These include:
* A formal definition of [[computation]] and [[computability]], and proof that there are computationally [[halting problem|unsolvable]] and [[Intractable#Intractability|intractable]] problems<ref>{{cite paper|author=Constable, R.L.|date=March 2000|url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/cis-dean/bgu.pdf|title=Computer Science : Achievements and Challenges circa 2000}}</ref>.
* The concept of a [[programming language]], a tool for the precise expression of methodological information at various levels of abstraction<ref>{{cite book|

== Relationship with other fields ==
{{main|Diversity of computer science}}
{{Wikiquotepar|Edsger Dijkstra}}

Despite its name, computer science rarely involves the study of computers themselves. In fact, the renowned computer scientist [[Edsger Dijkstra]] is often quoted as saying, ''"Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes."'' The design and deployment of computers and computer systems is generally considered the province of disciplines other than computer science. For example, the study of [[computer hardware]] is usually considered part of [[computer engineering]], while the study of commercial [[computer system]]s and their deployment is often called [[information technology]] or [[information systems]]. Computer science is sometimes criticized as being insufficiently scientific, a view espoused in the statement ''"Science is to computer science as hydrodynamics is to plumbing"'' credited to [[Stan Kelly-Bootle]]<ref>'''Computer Language''', Oct 1990</ref> and others.  However, there has been much cross-fertilization of ideas between the various computer-related disciplines. Computer science research has also often crossed into other disciplines, such as [[artificial intelligence]], [[cognitive science]], [[physics]] (see [[quantum computing]]), and [[linguistics]]. 

Computer science is considered by some to have a much closer relationship with [[mathematics]] than many scientific disciplines<ref>{{cite journal|last=Denning|first=P.J.|year=2000|title=[http://www.idi.ntnu.no/emner/dif8916/denning.pdf Computer science:the discipline]|journal=Encyclopedia of Computer Science}}</ref>. Early computer science was strongly influenced by the work of mathematicians such as [[Kurt Gödel]] and [[Alan Turing]], and there continues to be a useful interchange of ideas between the two fields in areas such as [[mathematical logic]], [[category theory]], [[domain theory]], and [[algebra]].

The relationship between computer science and [[software engineering]] is a contentious issue, which is further muddied by [[Debates within software engineering|disputes]] over what the term "software engineering" means, and how [[Diversity of computer science|computer science is defined]]. Some people believe that software engineering is a subset of computer science. Others, taking a cue from the relationship between other engineering and science disciplines, believe that the principle focus of computer science is studying the properties of computation in general, while the principle focus of software engineering is the design of specific computations to achieve practical goals, making them different disciplines. This view is promulgated by (among others) [[David Parnas]]<ref>{{cite journal | last = Parnas

}}, p. 19: "Rather than treat software engineering as a subfield of 
computer science, I treat it as an element of the set, {Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, 
Chemical Engineering, Electrical Engineering,....}."</ref>. Still others maintain that software cannot be engineered at all.

==Computer science education==
Some universities teach computer science as a theoretical study of computation and algorithmic reasoning.  These programs often feature the [[theory of computation]], [[analysis of algorithms]], [[formal methods]], [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrency theory]], [[databases]], [[computer graphics]] and [[systems analysis]], among others.  They typically also teach [[computer programming]], but treat it as a vessel for the support of other fields of computer science rather than a central focus of high-level study.

Other colleges and universities, as well as [[secondary school]]s and vocational programs that teach computer science, emphasize the practice of advanced [[computer programming]] rather than the theory of algorithms and computation in their computer science curricula.  Such curricula tend to focus on those skills that are important to workers entering the software industry. The practical aspects of computer programming are often referred to as [[software engineering]]. However, there is a lot of [[Debates within software engineering|disagreement]] over what the term "software engineering" actually means, and whether it is the same thing as programming.
