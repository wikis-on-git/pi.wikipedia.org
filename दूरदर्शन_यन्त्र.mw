'''टेलिभिजन''' एकस्य [[दूरसंचार]] यन्त्र [[चलचित्र]] व [[ध्वनि]] [[प्रसारण]] व संकलनेषु प्रयोजने| The term has come to refer to all the aspects of television from the [[television set]] to the [[television program|programming]] and [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]]. The word is derived from mixed Latin and Greek roots, meaning "far seeing" (Greek "tele," meaning far, and Latin "visus," meaning seeing).

== ईतिहास ==
The origins of what would become today's television system can be traced back as far as the discovery of the [[photoconductivity]] of the element [[selenium]] by [[Willoughby Smith]] in 1873, and the invention of a scanning disk by [[Paul Nipkow]] in 1884. All practical television systems use the fundamental idea of scanning an image to produce a time series signal representation. That representation is then transmitted to a device to reverse the scanning process. The final device, the television, relies on the human eye to integrate the result into a coherent image.

While electromechanical techniques were developed prior to World War II, most notably by [[Charles Francis Jenkins]] and [[John Logie Baird]], completely electronic television systems relied on the inventions of [[Philo Taylor Farnsworth]], [[Vladimir Zworykin]] and others to produce a system suitable for mass distribution of television programming. Commercial broadcast programming, following years of experimental broadcasts seen only in a few specially-equipped homes, occurred in both the United States and the United Kingdom before World War II.

The first television broadcasts with a modern level of definition (more than 240 lines) were made in England in 1936. So-called "System A" used 405 lines. Television did not become common in United States homes until the middle 1950s. While North American over-the-air broadcasting was originally free of direct marginal cost to the consumer (i.e., cost in excess of acquisition and upkeep of the hardware) and broadcasters were compensated primarily by receipt of advertising revenue, increasingly United States television consumers obtain their programming by subscription to cable television systems or direct-to-home satellite transmissions. In the United Kingdom, on the other hand, the owner of each television must pay a [[Television licence|license fee]] annually which is used to support the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]].

== Adoption ==

Although Britain was the first country in the world to start large-scale public transmissions, the public uptake was initially very slow. Television sets were very expensive at first, and prices did not drop to an affordable level until technology developed during the [[Second World War]] for [[radar]] was introduced. As well as making televisions cheaper, it also made them safer and much smaller. These smaller, cheaper sets were more acceptable to the public. A major driver for television uptake in Britain was the [[Coronation]] of [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1953. This event was viewed by over 20 million people, and was for many their first exposure to television. People gathered for [[Coronation parties]], and many people bought television receivers specially in time for the event. During the year after the Coronation, television licence subscription increased by 50%.

=== Elements of a television system ===
The elements of a simple television system are:
* An image source - this may be a [[Professional video camera|camera]] for live pick-up of images or a [[flying spot scanner]] for transmission of [[motion picture|films]]
* A sound source.
* A [[transmitter]], which modulates one or more [[television signal]]s with both picture and sound information for transmission. 
* A receiver (television) which recovers the picture and sound signals from the television broadcast.
* A display device, which turns the electrical signals into visible light and audible sound.

Practical television systems include equipment for selecting different image sources, mixing images from several sources at once, insertion of pre-recorded video signals, synchronizing signals from many sources, and direct image generation by computer for such purposes as station identification. Transmission may be over the air from land-based transmitters, over metal or optical cables, or by radio from synchronous [[Satellite television|satellites]]. Digital systems may be inserted anywhere in the chain to provide better image transmission quality, reduction in transmission [[bandwidth]], special effects, or security of transmission from reception by non-subscribers.

=== दृस्टि प्रविधि ===
दृस्टि प्रविधि विकाशेनु विभिन्न प्रकारेन आधुनिक टिभी निर्मानम्: 

* '''CRT''': The most common displays are direct-view [[cathode ray tube|CRTs]] for up to 40&nbsp;in (100&nbsp;cm) (in 4:3) and 46&nbsp;in (115&nbsp;cm) (in 16:9) [[diagonal]]ly. These are still the least expensive, and are a refined technology that can still provide the best overall picture quality. As they do not have a fixed [[native resolution]], in some cases they are also capable of displaying sources with a variety of different resolutions at the best possible image quality. The [[frame rate]] or refresh rate of a typical [[NTSC]] format CRT TV is 60&nbsp;Hz, and for the [[PAL]] format, it is 50&nbsp;Hz. A typical [[NTSC]] broadcast signal's visible portion has an equivalent resolution of about 640x480&nbsp;pixels. It actually could be slightly higher than that, but the [[Vertical blanking interval|Vertical Blanking Interval]], or VBI, allows other signals to be carried along with the broadcast.
* '''Rear projection''': Most very large screen TVs (up to over 100&nbsp;inch (254&nbsp;cm)) use [[projection]] technology. Three types of projection systems are used in projection TVs: CRT-based, [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]]-based, and [[DLP]] (reflective micromirror chip) -based. Projection television has been commercially available since the 1970s, but at that time could not match the image sharpness of the CRT; current models are vastly improved, and offer a cost-effective large-screen display. A variation is a [[video projector]], using similar technology, which projects onto a [[Projection screen|screen]].
* '''Flat panel LCD''' or '''plasma''': Modern advances have brought [[Flat panel display|flat panels]] to TV that use [[Active-matrix liquid crystal display|active matrix]] [[liquid crystal display|LCD]] or [[plasma display]] technology. Flat panel LCDs and [[plasma display]]s are as little as 1&nbsp;inch thick and can be hung on a wall like a picture or put over a [[pedestal]]. Some models can also be used as [[Computer display|computer monitors]].<br />{{seealso|Liquid crystal display television}}

It is important to think about the living environment of your television before deciding on a single display technology. Each has its pros and cons, Flat panel LCD display can have narrow viewing angles and so may not suit a home environment. Rear projection screens do not perform well in natural [[daylight]] or well lit rooms and so are best suited to dark viewing areas. A complete run down of the pros and cons of each display should be sought before purchasing a single television technology.

=== Terminology for televisions ===

Pixel [[Display resolution|resolution]] is the amount of individual points known as [[pixels]] on a given screen. A typical resolution of 800x600 means that the television display has 800 pixels across and 600&nbsp;pixels on the vertical axis. The higher the resolution on a specified display the sharper the image.  

Contrast [[ratio]] is a measurement of the range between the brightest and darkest points on the screen. The higher the contrast ratio, the better looking picture there is in terms of richness, deepness, and [[shadow]] detail.  

The [[brightness]] of a picture measures how vibrant and impacting the colours are. Measured in cd/m2 equivalent to the amount of candles required to power the [[image]].

=== Signal connections ===
The number of ways to connect a video device to a television has increased over the years:


* [[High-Definition Multimedia Interface|HDMI]] - a 19 or 29-pin industry-supported digital interface which supports standard, enhanced, or [[High-definition television|high-definition video]], plus multi-channel digital audio on a single cable. The video signal is [[Backward compatibility|backward-compatible]] with [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]]. Increasingly common on displays, DVD players, and high-end PC [[graphics card]]s. [[Copy protection]] is implemented using [[High-Bandwidth Digital Content Protection|HDCP]]. HDMI 1.3 is required to enable high-definition content on [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] and [[HD DVD]] disks.

[[File:DVI Connector.JPG|70px|right]]
* [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]] - a 17 to 29-pin connector that carries digital video signals, designed to carry [[High-definition television|HDTV]] but also used in current DVD players and latest digital displays. Copy protection is available using [[High-Bandwidth Digital Content Protection|HDCP]].

[[File:Component_video_RCA.jpg|70px|right]]
* [[Component video]] - three separate [[RCA connector|RCA jacks]] (colored red, green and blue) carry three [[Analog signal|analog]] video signals, one brightness ([[Luminance (video)|luminance]]) and two colors ([[Chrominance|chromas]]), and is usually referred to as "Y, B-Y, R-Y", "Y Cr Cb" ([[interlace]]d) or "Y Pr Pb" ([[Progressive scan|progressive]]), or [[YUV]]. Audio is not carried on this cable. This connection provides for picture quality superior to [[S-Video]] and is typically used in home theater for DVDs, satellite and analogue HDTV; it is less common in [[Europe]] but is starting to become more widely available.

[[File:SCART 20050724 003.jpg|70px|right]]
* [[SCART]] - a large 21 pin connector that may carry [[Analog signal|analog]] signals consisting of: one video signal [[composite video]]; or two video signals [[S-Video]]; or for picture quality similar to [[component video]], three signals of separate red, green and blue or [[RGB color model|RGB]]; or for best picture quality, four video signals of separate red, green, blue and [[Synchronization|sync]] or RGBS; plus right and left [[line-level]] audio channels; along with a number of control signals including an [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect-ratio]] flag (e.g. widescreen). This system has been standard in [[Europe]] since mid-1980s for all consumer electronics, which meant that RGBS was available on even the earliest [[PAL]] DVD players and satellite receivers. [[Japan]] uses a 21 pin RGB connector which is visually similar to SCART but with different pin configurations.  The SCART connector is not used in the [[United States|U.S.]]

[[File:SVideoConnector.jpg|70px|right]]
* [[S-Video]] - small round connector with two separate [[Analog signal|analog]] video signals, one carrying brightness (luminance), the other carrying color (chroma). Also referred to as Y/C video. Provides most of the benefit of component video, with slightly less color fidelity. Use started in the 1980s for [[S-VHS]], [[8 mm video format|Hi-8]], and early [[NTSC]] DVD players to relay high quality video before component was available.  This will sometimes, completely incorrectly, be referred to as an [[S-VHS]] connector.  Audio is not carried on this cable.

[[File:Composite.jpg|70px|right]]
* [[Composite video]] - The most common form of connecting external devices, putting all the [[Analog signal|analog]] video information into one signal. Most televisions provide this option with a yellow [[RCA connector|RCA jack]] or occasionally a [[BNC connector]]. Audio is not carried on this cable, though two separate cables with similar red and white RCA jacks for right and left [[line-level]] audio are commonly bonded to composite video cables.

* [[coaxial cable|Coaxial]] RF - All audio channels and picture components are transmitted through one [[coaxial cable]] and [[modulate]]d on a [[radio frequency]]. Most TVs manufactured since the 1970s provide a coaxial connection, and this is the type of cable typically used for [[cable television]]. Although still found on [[VHS]] tape-players, most modern DVD players and other video devices no longer supply an RF output, so very old TV sets made before composite video jacks became commonplace will need a [[modulation|modulator]] device. [[NTSC]] sets use a 75&nbsp;[[ohm]] F-connector; most [[PAL]] sets use a 50&nbsp;ohm Belling Lee. Most set-top TV antennas have a 300&nbsp;ohm [[Electrical impedance|impedance]], so to connect them to a coaxial input requires an inexpensive [[Balun|matching transformer]] to avoid signal degradation. 

* 300&nbsp;ohm [[twin-lead]] - The predecessor to [[coaxial cable]], generally a flat insulated cable with a pair of wires separated by 0.5&nbsp;inch, found on NTSC television sets from 1940 to about 1985, and originally used to connect the receiver to either an outdoor [[antenna]] or [[Dipole antenna|rabbit ears]], though twinlead line losses make an inefficient application for the former. Connection to the set was by connecting the wire to a pair of screws on the back of the television set. Nominal [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] was 300&nbsp;ohms; connecting an older set to cable or VCRs requires an inexpensive [[Balun|matching transformer]] to avoid signal degradation due to [[impedance mismatch]]. Twin-lead wiring is sensitive to nearby metal objects. Long runs must be properly supported away from metal objects and should be mounted with a loose twist in the cable - see [[unshielded twisted pair]] cables which operate by the same principle as properly installed twin-lead.

* [[Optical fiber|Fiber optic]] - The latest in connections and only on extremely new and high quality TVs, fiber optics use a [[laser]] to transmit data along a glass fiber. Used for sound and/or video, can be found on newer TVs, high end video editing systems, as well as in high end computer systems. Can be referred to as [[S/PDIF]] digital-audio format.

=== Aspect ratios ===
'''[[Aspect ratio (image)|Aspect ratio]]''' refers to the ratio of the horizontal to vertical measurements of a television's picture.  Mechanically scanned television as first demonstrated by [[John Logie Baird]] in 1926 used a 7:3 vertical aspect ratio, oriented for the head and shoulders of a single person in close-up.

Most of the early electronic TV systems from the mid-1930s onward shared the same [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of 4:3 which was chosen to match the [[Academy ratio|Academy Ratio]] used in cinema films at the time. This ratio was also square enough to be conveniently viewed on round [[cathode ray tube|cathode-ray tubes]] (CRTs), which were all that could be produced given the [[manufacturing]] [[technology]] of the time. (Today's CRT technology allows the manufacture of much wider tubes, and the flat-screen technologies which are becoming steadily more popular have no technical aspect ratio limitations at all.) The [[BBC]]'s television service used a more squarish [http://tcc.members.beeb.net/tchistory.html 5:4] ratio from 1936 to [http://www.pembers.freeserve.co.uk/Test-Cards/Test-Card-Technical.html#Aspect-Ratio 3 April 1950], when it too switched to a 4:3 ratio.  This did not present significant problems, as most sets at the time used round tubes which were easily adjusted to the 4:3 ratio when the transmissions changed.

In the 1950s, [[movie studio]]s moved towards [[widescreen]] aspect ratios such as [[CinemaScope]] in an effort to distance their product from television. Although this was initially just a [[gimmick]], widescreen is still the format of choice today and square aspect ratio movies are rare. Some people argue that widescreen is actually a disadvantage when showing objects that are tall instead of [[panorama|panoramic]], others say that natural vision is more panoramic than tall, and therefore widescreen is easier on the eye.

The switch to [[digital television]] systems has been used as an opportunity to change the standard television picture format from the old ratio of 4:3 (1.33:1) to an aspect ratio of 16:9 (approximately 1.78:1). This enables TV to get closer to the aspect ratio of modern widescreen [[film|movies]], which range from 1.66:1 through 1.85:1 to 2.35:1. There are two methods for transporting widescreen content, the better of which uses what is called [[full screen anamorphic|anamorphic widescreen]] format. This format is very similar to the technique used to fit a widescreen movie frame inside a 1.33:1 35mm film frame. The image is compressed horizontally when recorded, then expanded again when played back. The anamorphic widescreen 16:9 format was first introduced via European [[PALPlus]] television broadcasts and then later on "widescreen" [[DVD]]s; the [[ATSC]] [[High-definition television|HDTV]] system uses straight widescreen format, no horizontal compression or expansion is used.

Recently "widescreen" has spread from television to computing where both [[desktop computer|desktop]] and [[laptop]] computers are commonly equipped with widescreen displays. There are some complaints about distortions of movie picture ratio due to some DVD playback software not taking account of aspect ratios; but this will subside as the DVD playback software matures. Furthermore, computer and laptop widescreen displays are in the 16:10 aspect ratio both physically in size and in pixel counts, and not in 16:9 of consumer televisions, leading to further complexity. This was a result of widescreen computer display engineers' uninformed assumption that people viewing 16:9 content on their computer would prefer that an area of the screen be reserved for playback controls or [[subtitle]]s, as opposed to viewing content full-screen.

===== Aspect ratio incompatibility =====
The television industry's changing of [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratios]] is not without difficulties, and can present a considerable problem.

Displaying a widescreen aspect (rectangular) image on a conventional aspect (square) display can be shown:
* in "[[letterbox]]" format, with black horizontal bars at the top and bottom
* with part of the image being cropped, usually the extreme left and right of the image being cut off (or in "[[pan and scan]]", parts selected by an operator)
* with the image horizontally compressed

A conventional aspect (square) image on a widescreen aspect (rectangular) display can be shown:
* in "[[pillar box (film)|pillar box]]" format, with black vertical bars to the left and right
* with upper and lower portions of the image cut off (or in "tilt and scan", parts selected by an operator)
* with the image horizontally distorted

A common compromise is to shoot or create material at an aspect ratio of 14:9, and to lose some image at each side for 4:3 presentation, and some image at top and bottom for 16:9 presentation.  In recent years, the cinematographic process known as [[Super 35 mm film|Super 35]] (championed by [[James Cameron]]) has been used to film a number of major movies such as [[Titanic (1997 film)|''Titanic'']], ''[[Legally Blonde]]'', ''[[Austin Powers]]'', and ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' (see also: [[List of top-grossing films shot in Super 35]]).  This process results in a camera-negative which can then be used to create both wide-screen theatrical prints, and standard "[[full screen]]" releases for television/VHS/DVD which avoid the need for either "[[Letterbox|letterboxing]]" or the severe loss of information caused by conventional "[[pan-and-scan]]" cropping.

== Content ==
=== Advertising ===
Since their inception in the USA in 1940, [[television commercial|TV commercials]] have become one of the most effective, most pervasive, and most popular methods of selling products of many sorts, especially consumer goods. U.S. advertising rates are determined primarily by [[Nielsen Ratings]].

=== Programming ===
Getting TV programming shown to the public can happen in many different ways. After production the next step is to market and deliver the product to whatever markets are open to using it.  This typically happens on two levels:

# '''Original Run''' or '''First Run''' - a producer creates a program of one or multiple episodes and shows it on a station or network which has either paid for the production itself or to which a license has been granted by the producers to do the same.
# '''[[Television syndication|Syndication]]''' - this is the terminology rather broadly used to describe secondary programming usages (beyond original run). It includes secondary runs in the country of first issue, but also international usage which may or may not be managed by the originating producer. In many cases other companies, [[TV stations]] or individuals are engaged to do the syndication work, in other words to sell the product into the markets they are allowed to sell into by contract from the copyright holders, in most cases the producers.

In most countries, the first wave occurs primarily on [[Free-to-air|free-to-air (FTA)]] television, while the second wave happens on subscription TV and in other countries. In the U.S., however, the first wave occurs on the FTA networks and subscription services, and the second wave travels via all means of distribution.

First run programming is increasing on subscription services outside the U.S., but few domestically produced programs are syndicated on domestic FTA elsewhere. This practice is increasing however, generally on digital-only FTA channels, or with subscriber-only first run material appearing on FTA.

Unlike the U.S., repeat FTA screenings of a FTA network program almost only occur on that network. Also, [[Affiliate]]s rarely buy or produce non-network programming that isn't centered around local events.

== Social aspects ==
=== Alleged dangers ===
Paralleling television's growing primacy in family life and society, an increasingly vocal chorus of legislators, [[scientist]]s and [[parent]]s are raising objections to the uncritical acceptance of the medium. For example, the [[Sweden|Swedish]] government imposed a total ban on advertising to [[children]] under twelve in 1991 (see [[advertising]]). In the U.S., the [http://www.mediafamily.org/facts/facts_tveffect.shtml National Institute on Media and the Family] (not a government agency) points out that U.S. children watch an average of 25 [[hour]]s of television per week and features studies showing it interferes with the [[education]]al and maturational process.

Fifty years of research on the impact of television on children's emotional and social development (Norma Pecora, John P. Murray, & Ellen A. Wartella, Children and Television: 50 Years of Research, published by Erlbaum Press, June, 2006) demonstrate that there are clear and lasting effects of viewing violence.  In a recent study (February, 2006) published in the journal Media Psychology, volume 8, number 1, pages 25-37, the research team demonstrated that the brain activation patterns of children viewing violence show that children are aroused by the violence (increased heart rates), demonstrate fear (activation of the amygdala-the fight or flight sensor in the brain) in response to the video violence, and store the observed violence in an area of the brain (the Posterior Cingulate) that is reserved for long-term memory of traumatic events.

A [[23 February]] [[2002]] article in [http://www.sciam.com/print_version.cfm?articleID=0005339B-A694-1CC5-B4A8809EC588EEDF Scientific American] suggested that compulsive television watching was no different from any other [[addiction]], a finding backed up by reports of withdrawal symptoms among families forced by circumstance to cease watching.

A longitudinal study in [[New Zealand]] involving 1000 people (from childhood to 26 years of age) demonstrated that "television viewing in childhood and adolescence is associated with poor educational achievement by 26 years of age". In other words, the more the child watched television, the less likely he or she was to finish school and enroll in a [[university]].

The changes in TV equipment and programming has been noted as one of the largest changes known to people because it was vital to people in the past as well as in the present.

In [[Iceland]], television broadcasting hours were restricted until 1984, with no television programs being broadcast on Thursday, or during the whole of July.

Television's biggest social aspect is the fact that it allows users to instantly view content that may be occurring far away from where they are. Television has been a major contributor in the process of globalization. The Earth's residents can be linked by the programming they watch; but like the internet, television has been taken advantage of as a perfect medium for advertising and the spreading of thoughts and ideas.

=== Technology trends ===

In its infancy, television was an ephemeral medium.  Fans of regular shows planned their [[TV listings|schedules]] so that they could be available to watch their shows at their time of broadcast.  The term ''appointment television'' was coined by marketers to describe this kind of attachment.  

The viewership's dependence on schedule lessened with the invention of programmable video recorders, such as the [[Videocassette recorder]] and the [[Digital video recorder]].  Consumers could watch programs on their own schedule once they were broadcast and recorded.  Television service providers also offer ''video on demand,'' a set of programs which could be watched at any time.  

Both [[mobile phone]] networks and the [[internet]] are capable of carrying video streams. There is already a fair amount of internet TV available, either live or as downloadable programs. Mobile phone TV is planned to eventually become mainstream, after worldwide over-the-air digital TV takes over analogue and some technical difficulties can be overcome - especially the ones related to battery life.

=== Suitability for audience ===
Almost since the medium's inception there have been charges that some programming is, in one way or another, inappropriate, [[offensive]] or [[decency|indecent]]. Critics such as Jean Kilborne have claimed that television, as well as other mass media images, harm the self image of young girls.  Other commentators such as Sut Jhally, make the case that television advertising in the U.S. has been so effective that happiness has increasingly come to be equated with the purchasing of products. [[George Gerbner]] has presented evidence that the frequent portrayals of crime, especially minority crime, has led to the [[Mean World Syndrome]], the view among frequent viewers of television that crime rates are much higher than the actual data would indicate.  In addition, a lot of television has been charged with presenting propaganda, political or otherwise, and been pitched at a low intellectual level.
